## TO-DO

This is a todo website, I made to practice my basics in web development. This project was made to focus on logic rather than heavy styling.

The webapp has the main core features expected from a todo app:

- You can add tasks
- You can delete tasks
- Check tasks that are done
- A nice reminder pop-up when there are too many tasks (It was intentional)

It holds all the tasks in a chronological order. Latest task is at the top with the old tasks in the bottom.

## Technologies Used

It was made using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## File Structure

File Structure for the project:

```text

## Future Improvements

The future improvements would be:

- Add a storage system using Local Storage
- A Dark Mode (simply cause it hurts my eyes)
- Add a proper completed and uncompleted system
- Dates and stuff
